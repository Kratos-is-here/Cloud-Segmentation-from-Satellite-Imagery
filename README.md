# Cloud-Segmentation-UNET
This repository contains the first model which I tried on cloud dataset from sentinel satellite for cloud segmentation. The model was UNET and the loss function used was BinaryCrossEntropy with Logits. For, validation IoU was used. Accuracy of 81.39% could be achieved on the validation set using this model.
